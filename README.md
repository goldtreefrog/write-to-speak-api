# Write to Speak API - Thinkful Demo Project

## Back end with database connection to support the front end found at \_\_ . See the front end documentation for information about the user interface.

### NOTES

Because this is a demonstration project, your data **will be deleted** from time to time. When and if this becomes a production system, I will change this very page (as well as the page at the front end) to let everyone know. If you have a strong desire or need for such a system, please [contact me](http://mendoclick.com/contact.htm) to discuss how we can work together to meet your needs.
